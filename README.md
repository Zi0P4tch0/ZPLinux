# ZPLinux

<img src="./images/cmatrix.gif" width="500" height="300" />
    
A tailored Linux release for my 486 FreeDOS machine.

(Yeah, that's [cmatrix](https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix) burning the CPU)

Comes in two lovely floppy diskettes.

## Ideas & Solutions

- I want a modern kernel built with a modern toolchain
    - SOLUTION: **Build a bespoke i486 toolchain, and build the kernel with it**
- Glibc creates massive binaries and binary size is a top concern here
    - SOLUTION: **use musl instead of glibc**
- Cross-compiling on macOS is painful:
    - Filesystem issues (e.g. filesystem not being case-sensitive by default)
    - GNU tools don't always behave correctly
    - M1 is based on ARM - a few tools may not run at all (e.g. syslinux)
    - I don't want to pollute the filesystem of my Macbook.
    - SOLUTION: **Use Docker**

## Docker images

### Provided files

- `busybox-config` and `kernel-config` are self-explanatory.
- `busybox-init` is the main initramfs script.
- `entrypoint.sh` is the entrypoint script for the `zplinux` image that builds kernel and busybox, and also creates the floppies.
- `floppy.img` is a dump of a physical floppy diskette, formatted under FreeDOS 1.3RC5 and with Syslinux 4.x installed on it

---

### 486toolchain

This image builds a `i486-linux-musl-*` prefixed cross-compiler toolchain in `/toolchain`.

Only the `build-essential` package is kept installed at the end of the building process.

It is the base image for the `zplinux` one.

It also includes ncurses and zlib.

---

### zplinux

This image compiles and packages the kernel and busybox at build time.

The floppy disk(s) are created at runtime by the entrypoint script.

---

## Running

    # Build toolchain image
    docker build -t 486toolchain ./486toolchain 
    # Build zplinux image
     docker build -t zplinux ./zplinux
    # Finalise zplinux build 
    docker run --rm -ti -v /some/output/folder:/data --privileged zplinux

    # Once the floppy is built, copy it to /data
    docker-machine> cp /floppies/zplinux.img /data
    docker-machine> exit

    # Flash it (or test it in QEMU - see below)
    sudo dd if=/path/to/zplinux.img of=DEVICE bs=512 count=2880 conv=noerror,sync

## QEMU

    qemu-system-i386 -cpu 486 -m 16 -fda zplinux.img
